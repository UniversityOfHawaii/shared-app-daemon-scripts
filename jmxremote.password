# Sun's out-of-the-box JMX requires this jmxremote.password file to
# be readable by only the app's daemon user.  However, we expose this
# password by using it without SSL (because SSL is a pain).  So, our
# security comes not from the secrecy of this password, but from having
# no create clause on the nonCreateRole in jmxremote.access
# (and from our firewall limiting clients to our private network).
#
# Set this to what it should be.

nonCreateRole xxxxx
